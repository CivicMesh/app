# CivicMesh Mobile App

**CivicMesh** is a community-driven mobile platform that connects neighbors during emergencies and everyday challenges. Built with React Native and Expo, the app enables real-time reporting, response coordination, and resource sharing within local communities.

## What is CivicMesh?

CivicMesh transforms how communities respond to urgent situations by creating a hyperlocal network where residents can:

- **Report emergencies** like fires, floods, accidents, or security threats with precise geolocation
- **Request help** for immediate needs (medical assistance, shelter, supplies)
- **Share resources** such as food banks, charging stations, medical facilities, or temporary shelters
- **Coordinate responses** by marking "On My Way" to help neighbors in need
- **Resolve situations** with photo documentation and status updates

### Key Features

#### 📍 **Location-Based Feed**
- Interactive map showing active posts in your area
- Automatic geolocation for precise incident reporting
- Filter by category (Alert, Warning, Help, Resources, Accessibility Resources)
- Real-time updates as situations develop 

#### 📱 **Quick Reporting**
- Create posts in seconds with photos and location
- Categorize by urgency (Alert, Warning) or type (Help, Resources)
- Add subcategories for granular filtering (Medical, Fire, Flood, Food, etc.)
- Attach photos for visual context

#### 🤝 **Community Response**
- "On My Way" feature to signal you're responding to a post
- See who else is heading to help
- Resolution workflow with photo verification
- Track active vs. resolved situations

#### 🔐 **Simple Authentication**
- Quick signup with email/password
- Secure backend integration with HTTP Basic Auth
- Optional session persistence for convenience

### Use Cases

**During Emergencies:**
- A resident spots a fire and posts an alert with location and photo
- Neighbors mark "On My Way" and coordinate evacuation
- First responder resolves the post with status update

**Everyday Needs:**
- Someone needs urgent medical supplies → community members respond with available resources
- Power outage → posts about charging stations and generator locations
- Accessibility needs → share wheelchair-accessible routes or facilities

**Resource Sharing:**
- Map community fridges, food banks, and water distribution points
- Locate accessible public facilities
- Share temporary shelter locations during extreme weather

### How It Works

1. **Sign up** with your email and create an account
2. **Browse** the map or feed to see what's happening nearby
3. **Post** when you need help or spot an urgent situation
4. **Respond** to neighbors' posts by marking "On My Way"
5. **Resolve** posts when situations are handled, with photo proof
